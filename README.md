# Assigment Week 7 - Financial Tracker

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Ireng Febrian Sanjaya. I'm entering week 7 and I practicing in making website of financial tracker with HTML & CSS with Typescript and DOM.

## Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- TYPESCRIPT

## Process

1. First I'm making design of the website on HTML and CSS.
   - HTML (Code)
    ![HTML](https://github.com/febriaaan22/Febrian_week_7/blob/main/Documentation/html.png)
   - CSS (Code)
    ![CSS](https://github.com/febriaaan22/Febrian_week_7/blob/main/Documentation/css.png)
2. Next I'm running "npm --init" to make package.json and after it is installed change "author" and "description" with our name and project name.
   ![packagejson](https://github.com/febriaaan22/Febrian_week_7/blob/main/Documentation/package-json.png)
3. Install typescript with terminal "npm install -g typescript" and to check the version write "tsc --version" on the terminal. (ps. at this point I need to add Sudo because my permission is denied and I just realize that.) Here is picture below, you can check on package.json to make sure it is installed.

4. Run "tsc --init" and it will be tsconfig.json and next run "tsc --watch" to make sure compiling the file in watch mode.
5. On the tsconfig.json file go to line 29 and line 58;
- Click "command + /" and change line 29 string into "./src"

- same as above, change line 58 string into "./script"
![line58](https://github.com/febriaaan22/Febrian_week_7/blob/main/Documentation/outdir.png)
6. Make folder for script and src. Move "app.js into script files" and "app.ts into src files"
![example](https://github.com/febriaaan22/Febrian_week_7/blob/main/Documentation/example.png)
7. Next I'm making and writing the code on app.ts like below. (notes: by having tsconfig.json on our folder it help support our typescript to be compile to javascript so the browser could  support the typescript)
![appts](https://github.com/febriaaan22/Febrian_week_7/blob/main/Documentation/app(ts).png)
8. Before uploaded to GitHub, don't forget to make .gitignore files and write node_modules (to avoid all big size data came within the running).
9. After that I can savely run the website with several responsive javascript.
